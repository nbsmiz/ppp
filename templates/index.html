                In response to increasing unemployment due to shut downs in repoonse to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government
                provided a number of responses. One of these was the $669-billion 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program">Paycheck Protection Program</a>, intended to provide loans to small businesses
                to facilitate the retention of empoloyees during a time of suppressed economic activity.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Were any jobs saved?</li>
                        <li>How much did it cost to save these jobs?</li>
                        <li>Perhaps most important for an individual, did your community receive any assistance?</li>
